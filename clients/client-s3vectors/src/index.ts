/**
 * <p>Amazon S3 vector buckets are a bucket type to store and search vectors with sub-second search times. They are designed to provide dedicated API operations for you to interact with vectors to do similarity search. Within a vector bucket, you use a vector index to organize and logically group your vector data. When you make a write or read request, you direct it to a single vector index. You store your vector data as vectors. A vector contains a key (a name that you assign), a multi-dimensional vector, and, optionally, metadata that describes a vector. The key uniquely identifies the vector in a vector index.</p>
